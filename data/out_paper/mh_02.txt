Abstract —In recent years, there is an increasing demand for
unmanned aerial vehicles (UA Vs) to complete multiple applica-
tions. However, as unmanned equipments, UA Vs lead to some
security risks to general civil aviations. In order to strengthen
the flight management of UA Vs and guarantee the safety, UA Vs
can be equipped with automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast
(ADS-B) devices. In addition, as an automatic system, ADS-B can
periodically broadcast flight information to the nearby aircrafts
or the ground stations, and the technology is already used in civil
aviation systems. However, due to the limited frequency of ADS-B
technique, UA Vs equipped with ADS-B devices result in the loss
of packets to both UA Vs and civil aviation. Further, the operation
of civil aviation are seriously interfered. Hence, this paper firstly
examines the packets loss of civil planes at different distance, then
analyzes the impact of UA Vs equipped with ADS-B on the packets
updating of civil planes. The result indicates that the 1090MHz
band blocking is affected by the density of UA Vs. Besides, the
frequency capacity is affected by the requirement of updating
interval of civil planes. The position updating probability within
3s is 92.3 %if there are 200 planes within 50km and 20 UA Vs
within 5km. The position updating probability within 3s is 86.9 %
if there are 200 planes within 50km and 40 UA Vs within 5km.

I. I NTRODUCTION
WITH the development of low-altitude economics, the
unmanned aerial vehicles (UA Vs) play increasingly
important roles in this area [1]. Moreover, UA Vs are considered
as a significant technique in the future wireless access network
[2] [3]. UA Vs can be utilized to many applications, such as
surveillance system, aviation photography, information retrans-
mission, etc. Besides, UA Vs can be applied to many detailed
scenarios such as fire rescue, ecological observation, terrain
exploration, etc [4]. However, how to ensure the safe operation
of UA Vs becomes an important issue due to the lack of on-
board operation. One possible solution is to equip UA Vs with
automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) facilities,
which is maturely applied in civil aviations [5].
ADS-B in international civil aviation organization (ICAO)
is used to assist traditional primary and secondary radar
surveillance [6]. An aircraft equipped with ADS-B can auto-
matically transmit its position as well as other information to
the surrounding aircrafts, vehicles and ground stations (GS) [7].These information not only helpful to flying safety but to other
aspects like communication network as well [8]. The ADS-B
technique allows aircrafts to identify each other’s positions,
and automatically maintain safe distance. In addition, ADS-B
helps the air traffic controller (ATC) to monitor and control the
aircrafts on the route or approaching the airport terminal. In
short, ADS-B has the following advantages:
•ADS-B helps build new air route in remote aeras lacking
ground radar stations, such as polar regions, mountains
and oceans.
•ADS-B helps improve the navigation accuracy, reduce the
flight safety separation distance and increase the available
airspace.
•ADS-B helps the planes to climb and descend without the
contact with ATC, to avoid the unavailable airspace and
flexibly change air route.
UA Vs equipped with ADS-B system contribute to the fly-
ing safety, and simplify the UA V control by the air traffic
management (ATM). However, this approach has a limitation
that the ADS-B system in UA Vs and civil aviation share the
same frequency band (1090MHz). Due to the limited frequency
resources, if many UA Vs use this frequency band, the data
packets from UA Vs and civil planes will have conflicts, result-
ing in the packets loss and the longer delay of civil aviation
related information. It seriously interferes the monitoring of
civil aviation by the ATM. Due to the fault tolerance of air
route updating interval, some UA Vs can access within the
same frequency. However, the frequency resource utilization
decreases if the number of accessed UA Vs is too small. Thus,
how to balance the number of UA Vs and civil planes becomes
an essential problem.
There exist some related works, for example, [9] points out
that due to the low threshold of software defined radio and the
openness of 1090MHz, the packets loss in this frequency band
becomes increasingly serious. The loss rate of packets 50km
away from the GS is as high as 62 %. [10] points out that 1500
aircrafts can be support to send the ADS-B signal only if the
channel can be perfectly allocated. However, apart from ADS-
B signal (S-mode extended signal), there also exist abundant
S-mode and A/C-mode signal in the channel. Hence, the qua-arXiv:2307.01534v1  [eess.SP]  4 Jul 2023Planes with ADS -B

ntity of 1500 is only a theoretical value [11]. In [12], the
authors use the downlink format (DF) 17 code to represent civil
planes and the DF 18 code to represent UA Vs. It points out that
the influence of frequency band blocking is mainly affected by
the density and the signal transmission power of UA Vs. Based
on ALOHA protocol, [13] discusses the relationship between
the load and the throughput, and the relationship between the
number of planes and the successful receiving probability. [14]
points out that the channel capacity is mainly affected by the
link bit error rate, and changes as the requirement of packets
updating interval varies. However, these works don’t take the
civil planes and UA Vs into account at the same time. Also,
these works don’t consider the 3D model as well as the channel
error.
As shown in Fig. 1, this paper studies the influence of UA Vs
equipped with ADS-B on 1090MHz and analyzes the infulence
of certain number of UA Vs accommodated under a given
packets updating interval of civil planes. Firstly, this work
examines the packets collision loss of civil planes at different
distance without UA Vs. Then, we consider the error loss into
the channel propagation. Finally, we analyze the packets loss of
civil planes with different number of UA Vs. The data indicates
that the 1090MHz band blocking is affected by the density of
the UA Vs. Besides, the frequency capacity is affected by the
requirement of updating interval of civil planes.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The ADS-B
related packets are introduced in Section II. Channel model
is introduced in Section III. Section IV provides the simula-
tion results and corresponding analyses. Section V draws the
conclusions.TABLE II

II. ADS-B R ELATED PACKETS
This Section demonstrates the structure of classic ADS-B
packet and the functions of different fields. Then, this Section
elaborates the detailed information about airborne position
packet. Finally, this Section introduces the shaking interval of
all ADS-B affiliated packets.
A. Structure of Classic ADS-B Packet
ADS-B is the S-mode extended data packet, and its main
body length is 112 bits, as shown in Table I [15]. The DF field
is 5 bits long and is used to distinguish different downlink
formats. DF=17 indicates that the S-mode transponder sends
ADS-B packets, while DF=18 indicates that the nonS-mode
transponder sends ADS-B packets. The code ability/code for-
mat (CA/CF) field has different meanings with different DF
values. If DF=17, the field is CA, indicating the transponder
capability. If DF=18, the field is CF, indicating the encoding
format. The aircraft address (AA) field indicates the address
of the transmitting device. The message (ME) field contains
the ADS-B service data. The parity and identity (PI) field is
a downlink field, indicating parity and identity. However, each
ADS-B packet has 8 bits control string, so a single ADS-B
packet has a total of 120 bits and lasts 120 µs. ADS-B packets
are sent periodically by the aircrafts, or the corresponding
packets can be sent after being triggered by specific events.
Different ME fields respectively contain the aircraft airborne
position (POS), aircraft identification and category (ID), air-
borne velocity (VEL), aircraft operational status (AOS), aircraft
target status and other information (TSS). Different ADS-B
packets and their corresponding generating interval are shown
in Table II. The average generating interval of POS packet is
0.5s, and the interval of VEL packet is 0.5s. Furthermore, the
interval of ID packet is 5s, and the interval of AOS packet is
2.5s. The interval of TSS packet is 1.25s. In order to mitigate
conflicts, the generating interval is not a fixed interval, but a
shaking interval.
B. Airborne Position Packet
The ADS-B system broadcasts the POS packets to the
outside world with a period of 0.5s, which is the most importantpacket of all ADS-B afiliated packets. After receiving several
POS packets, the GS generates the track of the corresponding
aircraft on its radar. When packets are continuously lost, the
GS clears the flight path of the aircraft, and the aircraft is
deemed to leave its controlled airspace. Due to the impact
of packets collision or channel fading, POS packets are lost
inevitably. So the position updating interval is introduced to
measure the updating quality, which means the GS doesn’t need
to receive all the POS packets, but to receive a POS packet in
a limited time. As shown in Table III, as for the air-ground
data link, the ADS-B receiver at the airport terminal requires a
95%probability of no more than 3s, for the updating interval
of the POS packet of the aircrafts within 3 miles. The ADS-
B receiver on the air route requires a 95 %probability of no
more than 6s, for the updating interval of the POS packet of
the aircrafts within 5 miles [16].
C. The shaking interval
In this paper, we introduce the shaking interval to replace the
average generating interval aiming to mitigate packets conflict.
As shown in Table II, the shaking interval of POS packet is
[0.4s, 0.6s]. The shaking interval of VEL packet is [0.4s, 0.6s].
The shaking interval of ID packet is [4.8s, 5.2s]. The shaking
interval of AOS packet is [2.4s, 2.6s]. The shaking interval
of TSS packet is [1.2s, 1.3s]. The S-mode packet (SMAG)
payload is 56-bits, and with the 8 bits control string, the actual
total length is 64 bits. In [17], the authors point out that the
ratio of the number of S-mode and ADS-B packets is 1:1, so
we assume that each aircraft transmits 5 S-mode packets per
second.
III. C HANNEL MODEL
As shown in Fig. 1, planes are randomly distributed in the
airspace with a radius of 50km. Due to the small size and
limited endurance distance, UA Vs are randomly distributed in
the airspace with a radius of 5km. The ADS-B receiver in GS
is located in the two-dimensional geometric center within the
airspace range.
All planes and UA Vs access the channel of 1090MHz by
random access, i.e., the ALOHA protocol is adopted as the
media access control (MAC) protocol.
All aircrafts are within the one-hop range, i.e., packets do
not need to be relayed. If a packet has no error code during
the channel transmission and does not overlap with the packets
sent by other aircrafts, it can reach the GS and be correctly
received.
In processing radio signals, the power or amplitude of a
signal is usually expressed in decibels (dB). The following
formulas use dB to express the signal relationship.
The ADS-B transmission power of the planes are fixed at P
(dBm) and the ADS-B transmission power of the UA Vs are
fixed at p(dBm). GS is set as a ADS-B receiving station
with a receiving sensitivity of A(dBm). A random distance
parameter d∈(0km∼50km) is generated for each aircraft,
and it represents the straight distance from the aircraft to GS.When the considered time is small, it is assumed that each
aircraft is quasi-static, i.e., the distance from each aircraft to
GS is invariable. All software-defined radio transmissions are
considered as line-of-sight. f(MHz) represents the working
frequency. Then, the propagation Loss (dBm) is calculated by
the following propagation formula:
Loss = 32.44 + 20lg d+ 20lg f. (1)
ADS-B packets adopt 8 PSK channel encoding form for 112
bits [18] [19]. The input signal power of the demodulator S
(dBm) is:
S=P−Loss. (2)
AndSmust satisfies: S≥A. The gaussian white noise
power is N=n0×B.n0is the power density of gaussian white
noise, and Bis the bandwidth. Since the ADS-B system oper-
ates at 1090MHz, this frequency band belongs to the ultra-high
frequency. In the civil aviation system, 962MHz ∼1213MHz is
used for distance measuring equipment system, and the channel
interval is 1MHz. However, 1090MHz is remained for the
ADS-B system. Hence, the bandwidth B=1MHz. The input
signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the demodulator is r:

When Mis 8, the bit error rate Peformula is approximated as:

In reality, there are three situations for packets loss: packets
collision, packets error, and error packet conflicts with intact
packet. Packets collision means two packets arrive at the GS
simultaneously, which makes the packets discarded. Packets
error means some error codes occur during the channel propa-
gation, which also makes the packets discarded. What’s more
the packet may continue to reach the GS even it has bit errors
and conflicts with intact packet, resulting in packets collision.
Therefore, it is not possible to simply generate a random factor
at the aircraft to judge whether the packet has bit errors and
discard it directly. Besides, a random factor cannot be generated
at the GS to determine whether the packet has bit errors and
discard it directly. Moreover, to guarantee the fairness to all
packets, random factor i∈(0∼1)is set in the aircraft. And
ifi <(1−Pe), we record it as a good packet in the array.
Ifi≥(1−Pe), the packet is recorded as a bad packet in the
array. Since all packets propagating in the free space, leading
to the collisions with each other and generating packets loss,
the GS discards bad packets in statistics collection.Start

IV. S IMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSES
In this Section, we use CodeBlocks to conduct simulations,
aiming to examine the capcity of 1090MHz. The simulations
are based on queueing system with discrete events. The events
only appear at countable time points, so the system state can
only change at countable time points. Without continuity, event
processing only needs to be carried out when events change.
The system simulation flow chart is shown in the Fig. 2. The
total simulation time is set as 500 seconds. The operating
frequency is 1090MHz.

In Fig. 3, 50/100/150/200 planes are set respectively, and
the ADS-B only sends POS packet and ID packet. There only
exists collision packets loss. The number of planes and the
received ratio are shown in Fig. 3. As from the Fig. 3, different
numbers of planes correspond to different received ratio. As the
number of planes increases, the collision of packets intensifies,
and the received ratio decreases.
As shown in Fig. 4, the number of planes is fixed as 200,
and the ADS-B sends POS packet, ID packet, VEL packet, TSS
packet, AOS packet and S-mode packet. There exists collision
packets loss. As shown in Fig. 4, after the introduction of 6
kinds of packets, the received ratio decreases significantly, and
the average received ratio is 68.15 %. The loss of the POS
packet of GS is shown in Table IV. The preceding packets loss
cases do not include each other. GS successfully receives 632
POS packets and lost 372 POS packets. The average period of
generating POS packet is 0.5s. If the requirement of updating
interval is 3s, i.e., more than 6 consecutive packets loss are
regarded as the position is not updated. The position updating
probability within 3s is 97.8 %.
As demonstrated in Fig. 5, each plane is added with the
distance factor, and the packets propagation is added with the
channel model. After adding the distance factor, apart from
the loss of packets caused by collision, error codes caused by
propagation loss also make packets discarded. The number of
planes is fixed as 200, and the ADS-B sends 6 kinds of packets.
The relationship between the received ratio and distance is
shown in Fig. 5. As the distance increases, the propagation
loss increases, the packet error increases, and the received ratio
decreases. The average received ratio is 48.66 %. The loss of
the POS packet of GS is shown in Table IV. In total, 464 POS
packets are received and 533 POS packets are lost. The average
period of generating POS packet is 0.5s. If the requirement of
updating interval is 3s, i.e., more than 6 consecutive packets
loss are regarded as the position is not updated. The position
updating probability within 3s is 93.2 %.0 50 100 150 200

A total of 200 planes and 20 UA Vs are set in Fig. 6.
The planes are randomly distributed in the 0 ∼50km airspace
range with P=44dBm (25W), and the UA Vs are randomly
distributed in the 0 ∼5km airspace range with p=30dBm (1W).
The receiving sensitivity Aof GS is set as -93dBm. All aircrafts
send 6 kinds of packets and there exist collision loss and
error loss. The relationship between the received ratio and
distance of planes and UA Vs is shown in Fig. 6. Due to
the limited frequency band of 1090MHz, the introduction of
UA Vs aggravates the packets collision loss of planes. At the
same time, due to the limited load of UA Vs, the transmission
power of ADS-B on UA Vs is also smaller than that of planes.
Therefore, although the distance between GS and UA Vs is
shorter, UA Vs loss rate is larger than that of civil planes. The
average received ratio of GS is 46.55 %. The loss of POS packet
of GS is shown in Table IV. A total of 579 POS packets are
received, and 422 POS packets are lost. If the requirement of
updating interval is 3s, i.e., more than 6 consecutive packets
loss are regarded as the position is not updated. The position
updating probability within 3s is 92.3 %.
In Fig. 7, a total of 200 planes and 40 UA Vs are considered.
The planes are randomly distributed in the 0 ∼50km airspace
range with P=44dBm (25W), and the UA Vs are randomly
distributed in the 0 ∼5km airspace range with p=30dBm (1W).
The receiving sensitivity Aof GS is set as -93dBm. All aircrafts

send 6 kinds of packets and there exist collision loss and error
loss. The relationship between the received ratio and distance
of planes and UA Vs is shown in Fig. 7. The average received
ratio of the GS is 45.25 %. The loss of the POS packet of GS
is shown in Table IV. A total of 364 POS packets are received
and 629 POS packets are lost. If the requirement of updating
interval is 3s, i.e., more than 6 consecutive packets loss are
regarded as the position is not updated. The position updating
probability within 3s is 86.9 %.
V. C ONCLUSIONS
This work analyses the impact of UA Vs equipped with ADS-
B on the civial planes at the frequency of 1090MHz. A couple
of conditions are set up. Firstly, we assume that only civil
planes sending 2 kinds of packets access the 1090MHz, as the
number of planes increases, the received ratio decreases. The
packets may be discarded only due to collision loss. Then, we
add 6 kinds of packets, which accords with the actual situation.
Furthermore, we introduce the channel model, which means the
packets may be discarded due to the error loss. Finally, we add
the UA Vs into the simulation, examining the received ratio and
the position updating probability. The simulation data indicatesTABLE IV

that the 1090MHz band blocking is affected by the density of
the UA Vs. Besides, the frequency capacity is affected by the
requirement of updating interval of civil planes. As the distance
increases, the received ratio decreases. The loss ratio of planes
50km away from GS can approximately reach 60 %. Moreover,
when there are 200 planes in the 50km radius airspace and 20
UA Vs in the 5km radius airspace, the average received ratio of
GS is 46.55 %and the position updating probability is 92.3 %.
If the number of UA Vs changed to 40, the average received
ratio of GS is 45.25 %and the position updating probability is
86.9%.
