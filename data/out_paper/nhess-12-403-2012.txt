Abstract. In this paper, one meteorological case study for
twoIranianairportsarepresented. Attemptshavebeenmade
tostudythepredeﬁnedthresholdamountsofsomeinstability
indices such as vertical velocity and relative humidity. Two
important output variables from a numerical weather predic-
tion model have been used to survey thunderstorms. The
climatological state of thunder days in Iran has been deter-
mined to aid in choosing the airports for the case studies.
The synoptic pattern, atmospheric thermodynamics and out-
put from a numerical weather prediction model have been
studiedtoevaluatetheoccurrenceofstormsandtoverifythe
threshold instability indices that are based on Gordon and
Albert (2000) and Miller (1972).
Using data from the Statistics and Data Center of the Iran
Meteorological Organization, 195 synoptic stations were
usedtostudytheclimatologicalpatternofthunderstormdays
inIranduringa15-yrperiod(1991–2005). Synopticweather
maps and thermodynamic diagrams have been drawn using
data from synoptic stations and radiosonde data. A 15-km
resolution version of the WRF numerical model has been
implemented for the Middle East region with the assistance
of global data from University Corporation for Atmospheric
Research (UCAR).
The Tabriz airport weather station has been selected for
further study due to its high frequency of thunderstorms
(morethan35thunderstormdaysperyear)andtheexistence

1 Introduction
Since 1951, several techniques for predicting severe thun-
derstorms have been presented. Most of these methods are
applicable for large-scale systems that are dominant in a
given region (Fawbush et al., 1953; Miller, 1972). Doswell
et al. (1981) and Maddox and Doswell (1982) have shown
that these previously recommended methods were not suit-
able for thunderstorm forecasting because all severe thun-
derstormsdevelopduetomesoscalefactorsinanappropriate
synoptic context. It is, therefore, necessary to study the be-
haviour of thunderstorms in mesoscale conditions. Moore
et al. (2003) have investigated the environment of warm-
season elevated thunderstorms associated with heavy rain-
fall over the central United States. Jacobs and Maat (2005)
have presented numerical guidance methods for aiding the
decisionmakingrelatedtoaviationmeteorologicalforecasts.
Ramis et al. (2009) analysed a severe thunderstorm that oc-
curred on 4 October 2007 in Mallorca, Spain from an obser-
vational viewpoint. It was found that the synoptic scenario
wascharacterisedbytheadvectionofwarm,moistairatlow

levels over the Balearic Islands and an upper-level trough
over mainland Spain.
Vertical velocity, relative humidity and wind shear, which
can be retrieved from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)
model output, are very useful products for diagnosing the
structure of thunderstorms. Colquhoun (1987, 1998) intro-
duced the threshold values of these variables that are needed

occurrence in terms of a decision tree and has shown that a
vertical velocity larger than 0.5ms−1at 800hPa and a rela-
tive humidity larger than 75% are suitable threshold values
for thunderstorm occurrence.
Systematic methods to diagnose the atmosphere’s poten-
tial to produce severe convective weather can be of great
help to forecasters. The most notable of these systematic
approaches, the methods developed by Gordon and Al-
bert (2000) and Miller (1972), applied in this paper. The
checklists and reference guides developed by Gordon and
Albert, and Miller are speciﬁcally designed to aid in the di-
agnosis of severe convective conditions.
Instability is a critical factor in the development of severe
weather, and severe weather instability indices can be a use-
fultoolwhenappliedcorrectlytoagivenconvectiveweather
situation. Severe weather indices only indicate the potential
for convection. A lifted index with a value of 0◦C is sufﬁ-
cient for severe weather development only if the dynamics
are very strong. When the lifting index is −8◦C or less,
severe weather can occur with very weak upper-air support
(Hales, 1996). Some of the most common indices that are
applied in the study of thunderstorms are used in this paper:
theKIndex(George,1960),theLiftedIndex(Galway,1956),
the Showalter Stability Index (Showalter, 1953), Total To-
tals (Miller, 1972), the Severe Weather Threat Index (Miller,
1972), Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) and
Convective Inhibition (CIN). A brief history of the applica-
tion of these indices is described below.
In 1960, George introduced the relationship between KI
and thunderstorm probability. According to his research,
thunderstorms will occur with a 50% probability if the KI
value is 26◦C or more.
In1956,GalwayshowedthecriticalvaluesofLIforinsta-
bility and argued that a negative LI indicates that the bound-
ary layer is unstable with respect to the middle troposphere.
This instability represents an environment in which convec-
tion can occur. Galway declared that LI values between −3
and−5◦C represent marginal instability. Showalter (1953)
presented the threshold values of SI for thunderstorms, indi-
cating that SI values from 0 to −4◦C are suitable for mod-
erate thunderstorms. The Total Totals and SWEAT indices
were described by Miller in 1972. A SWEAT index be-
tween300and400indicatesmoderatethunderstormactivity,
while a TT index between 50 and 55◦C shows the possi-
bility of severe thunderstorm activity. Generally, tornadoes
are possible with thunderstorms when the SWEAT index
reaches more than 400 (Henz, 2009). CAPE values less than300Jkg−1show little or no convective potential, and CIN
values greater than 200Jkg−1are sufﬁcient to prevent con-
vection (Knutsvig, 2009). Haklander et al. (2003) examined
32differentindicesandparameters,especiallyintheNether-
lands,togainstatisticalinformationontheseparametersand
compare their ability to forecast thunderstorms. Haklander
and Delton (2003) have estimated the probability of a thun-
derstorm as a function of various thunderstorm predictors.
Theyfoundthatthethunderstormprobabilitydependsonthe
following parameters (in order of importance): latent insta-
bility (especially near the surface), potential instability and
conditional instability.
In the remaining sections of this paper, the synoptic con-
ditionsassociatedwiththunderstormeventsarereviewedfor
the two case studies. In addition, NWP model output and
the threshold values of important thermodynamic instability
indicesforthesetwocasestudiesarepresented. Section2de-
scribes the synoptic and upper-air data that are necessary to
drawthesynoptic,thermodynamicandclimatologicalcharts.
Also in this section, the WRF model is described in more
detail. The climatology of thunderstorm days is used to de-
scribe the level of thunderstorm occurrence in Iran. This cli-
matology has been analysed for a period of 15yr, and the
stationswiththemostandleastthunderstormdayshavebeen
noted. The climatology of thunderstorm days in Iran is pre-
sented in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, two case studies are analysed

dynamic indices for thunderstorm forecasting, and the simi-
laritywithotherstudiesisshown. Theveriﬁcationresultsare
discussedinSect.5. Finally,adiscussionofthepotentialfor
these indices to improve forecasts is given in Sect. 6, along
with possibilities for future improvements.
2 Data
To identify the most appropriate indices for thunderstorm
development at the two chosen airports in Iran, we needed
to obtain more information about the climatology of thun-
derstorm days in the country. To better understand the
thunderstorm climatology, we investigated the annual aver-
age number of thunder days that occurred in a 15-yr pe-
riod. The primary data for this study were obtained from
the archives of the I.R. of the Iran Meteorological Orga-
nization for the years 1990–2005 at 195 synoptic stations.
The Surfer software programme and the Kriging interpo-
lation method were used to analyse the data. The synop-
tic conditions were analysed using Global Forecast System
(GFS) data with 1◦resolution in both latitude and longi-
tude (http://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov/data.php ). The thermo-
dynamic diagrams were completed with upper-air sounding
data from the University of Wyoming ( http://weather.uwyo.
edu/upperair/sounding.html ). Because of their importance
in forecasting thunderstorms on the mesoscale, the vertical
velocity, relative humidity and temperature ﬁelds from the

3 The climatology of thunderstorm days in Iran
A thunderstorm occurs in response to synoptic-scale and
mesoscale forcing. To develop a thunderstorm it usually
needswarmandmoistairatlowlevels,coolanddryairatup-
perlevelsandasynoptic-scaledisturbance. Underthesecon-
ditions,thunderstormformationisprobable. Infact,thunder-
stormdevelopmentrequireslargeinstability,verticalforcing,
water vapour convergence at low levels and a high convec-
tive available energy; the synoptic-scale and mesoscale fea-
tures described above favour these conditions. Several cli-
matological studies have examined thunderstorms and their
associated phenomena such as hail, heavy precipitation and
severe winds. A study by Whiteman (2003) that considered
the inﬂuence of orography on thunderstorms describes some
of these climatological issues very well. Iran is located in a
dry to semi-dry climate zone; therefore, moisture is gener-
allynotplentiful,andalargenumberofthunderdaysarenot
expected. Duringthewarmseason,theAzoreshighpressure
dominates over Iran via the Mediterranean Sea. The Azores
high covers the area south of the Alborz Mountains, and sta-
ble conditions cover all of Iran. During the cold season,

the westerlies are dominant over Iran. The westerlies steer
Mediterranean disturbances toward Iran, causing instability
and precipitation. Gheibi et al. (2003) presented temporal
andspatialdistributionsofthunderstormsinIranandshowed
that the annual distribution of thunderstorms is concentrated
over the northwestern part of Iran. Thunderstorms usually
occur during the spring and summer in Iran (Alijani, 2009),
and for this reason, we selected our case studies in April.
As noted earlier, the two airports (Tehran and Tabriz) are se-
lected for further study due to their relatively large number
ofthunderstormdaysandairtrafﬁc. Tehranislocatedonthe
southern slopes of the Alborz Mountains (35.7◦N, 51.4◦E).
Thecityhasadryclimatewithwarmsummersandrelatively
cold winters. Although the Alborz Mountains are far from
the Tehran station (approximately 70km), the lifting effect
of the mountains may intensify the vertical motion due to
frontal convergence (Fig. 1). The Tabriz station (38.6◦N,
46.3◦E)islocatedinnorthwesternIran. TheSabalanMoun-
tains are located east of the city of Tabriz, while the Sahand
Mountains are located south of the city (Fig. 1). Due to the
orographic conditions, Tabriz has a cold and moist climate.
Its topography provides favourable conditions for thunder-
storm formation. Warm air rising and cold air sinking (con-
vection) play a key role in the formation of severe thunder-
storms. If the warm air at the surface is forced to rise, it will
continue to rise because it is less dense than the surrounding
air. In addition, it will transfer heat from the land surface
to the upper levels of the atmosphere through the convection
process. The orographic conditions cause thunderstorm for-
mationbyforcingairupwardalongthesideofamountainor

The number of thunderstorm days peaks at approximately 9
and 4.5 days for Tabriz and Tehran, respectively.
A climatological study of thunderstorm events can help to
identify airport stations with more thunder days. The pat-
tern of thunderstorm days in Iran is shown in Fig. 3, which
showsthatthunderstormsarenotcommoninIran. Addition-
ally, Fig. 3 shows that the minimum number of stormy days
occurs at the Jask station (one of Iran’s southern islands in
the Oman sea) with an average of 1.7 days annually and that
the maximum number of stormy days occurs at the Makoo
station in northwestern Iran with an average of 52 days an-
nually. ExaminingFig.3inthecontextoftheclimatological,
meteorologicalandorographicconditionsdescribedabove,a
moredetailedpictureofIran’sthunderstormclimatologycan
be seen. For example, the maximum in thunderstorm days
in northwestern Iran can be attributed to the orographic fea-
tures found in that region. In contrast, the central, eastern
and southeastern parts of Iran have the minimum number of
thunderstormdaysduetothepresenceoftheLootandKavir
deserts, which have very little moisture. The highest num-
ber of thunderstorm days occurs in the western half of the
country, particularly in the northwestern part of the country
where storms occur more than 20 days of the year. Stations

mostlylocatedinnorthwesternIran. Stationswithmorethan
45stormydaysaremarkedinFig.3. Additionally,morethan
70 stations have less than 10 thunderstorm days annually.
These stations are mostly located in the central and south-
eastern portions of the country. There are approximately
16 days per year with thunderstorms at the Tehran station
inTehran. Itisclearthatthepredictionofthunderstormdays

this reason, we study some of the most important indicators
for identifying and predicting storms at the Tabriz Airport
because of its large number of days with thunderstorms and
at the Tehran Airport because of its large number of ﬂights.

A pressure gradient was present on the west coast of the
Caspian Sea and on the southern slopes of the central Al-
borz Mountains while there was a centre of high pres-
sure (1015hPa) in the western part of Iran (Fig. 4a). By
12:00UTC,thepatternchangedasthepolarlowdeepenedin
the north and the Siberian high weakened (Fig. 4b). These
conditions produced a pressure gradient in the southwest-
ern portion of the Alborz Mountains. The surface pres-
sure was 1011hPa (1009hPa) at 00:00UTC and 1009hPa
(1005hPa) at 12:00UTC, while the dewpoint temperature
was∼10◦C (6◦C) at the Tehran (Tabriz) station at both
times. At 00:00UTC, the Tabriz station was affected by a
ridge of high pressure, but the Tehran station was not yet
affected. The850-hPachartshowsanapproachinglowpres-

troughs intermittently passed across the northwestern and
central Alborz Mountains at 00:00 and 12:00UTC, respec-
tively (Fig. 6a and b). One of these troughs, while passing
overthecentralAlborzMountains,producedathunderstorm
event in the Tehran area, which was reported at 12:00UTC.
In addition, the temperatures at 500hPa showed weak ad-
vection of cold air in the western half of Iran. At 300hPa,
there was no discernible strong jet streak at either 00:00 or
12:00UTC. However, a 60-knot wind speed (30ms−1) was
reportedattheRashtupperairstationat00:00UTC(Fig.7a),
while only a 20 knot (10ms−1) wind speed was recorded at
the Tabriz station at this time. At the Tehran station, the
wind speed values at 00:00UTC and 12:00UTC were 45
and 50 knots (22 and 25ms−1), respectively. These val-
ues support the fact that no considerable velocity was re-
ported for the jet stream that passed over Tehran. The Rasht
and Tabriz stations only had sounding data at 12:00UTC
(Fig.7b);therefore,theunstableconditionscanonlybequal-
itatively derived from synoptic conditions at the Tehran sta-
tion at 12:00UTC.

To study the status of thunderstorm development
more precisely, thermodynamic diagrams from the

were reviewed. Atmospheric instability indices including

(b)300hPa chart on 30 April 2009 at 12:00UTC.
SI, LI, KI, SWEAT, TT, CAPE and CIN were calculated
(Table 2). Because the Tabriz event did not occur exactly
over the station at 00:00UTC, the thermodynamic diagram
shown in Fig. 8a does not contain considerable instability.
There is no signiﬁcant observed jet stream in the 200 to
300hPa layer, and the values of the instability indices indi-
cate a non-storm environment, which is shown in Table 2.
Duetothelackofsigniﬁcantinstability,wedidnotcalculate

the dewpoint and temperature proﬁles indicate unstable con-
ditions (strong convergence of the temperature and humidity
proﬁles) and a 60 knot wind velocity in the 200 to 300hPa
layer (Fig. 8b). Based on the criteria for thunderstorm
occurrence from Galway (1956) and George (1960), the LI,
KI and SI indices in Tehran at 12:00UTC are acceptable for
thunderstorm formation.

700- to 800-hPa layer. Figure 9a closely corresponds with
the observed values by showing that at 00:00UTC the thun-
derstorm was not active in Tabriz. Figure 9b shows a ver-
tical cross-section of VVP. Regions of upward motion were
observed in the 700 to 800hPa layer, and the values werebetween 0.5 and 1ms−1, which are in agreement with the
results from Colquhoun (1987, 1998). Figure 10 shows val-
ues of humidity and temperature at 700hPa. Figure 10a
(Fig. 10b) shows that the temperature at the Tabriz (Tehran)
station is ∼2◦C (4◦C) with a relative humidity of less than
60% (90%).
4.4 The Gordon and Miller checklists
The severity of the thunderstorm events in these two case
studies was investigated using the data described above and
the checklists provided by Gordon and Albert (2000) and
Miller (1972). Table 3 is a checklist that can be used to

predict and identify thunderstorms and their severity. As the
table shows, of the 10 important parameters used to forecast
thunderstorms and severe weather, approximately 6 of these
parameters show a positive response for the Tehran station.
Infact,answerstothequestionsrelatedtoparameters4,5,6,

the severity of the event at the Tehran station at 12:00UTC
on 30 April 2009, we used the Miller checklist. The sur-
facepressuremap(Fig.4b)andthethermodynamicdiagrams

12h (00:00UTC to 12:00UTC) is between 0 and −3 hPa.
In addition, the temperature axis at 850hPa is located to
the east of the moisture axis, and the dewpoint temperature
is less than 8◦C. The maximum jet stream velocity is less
than 66kt (33ms−1) in the 200- to 300-hPa layer, and the
mean relative humidity is ∼77%. Using Table 2, we can
determine the instability indices: TT =54.6◦C, LI=−3◦C,
CAPE=314JKg−1, SWEAT =256 and SI =−2◦C. Based
on Table 3, most of the Miller checklist parameters indicate
a moderate to severe thunderstorm event. The same analysis
was performed for the Tabriz station. The results are shown
in Table 3. Using radiosonde data from the Tabriz station
(Fig. 7a), the data show that only 2 of the parameters (1 and
3)werepositive,whiletheremaining8parameterswereneg-
ative. This result means that the thunderstorm is not active
and,accordingtoGordon,itwillnotbenecessarytoproceed
to the Miller checklist because there are less than 6 positive
answers in the Gordon checklist.

5 Discussion
In our case studies, the synoptic charts present a weak pres-
suregradientoverTehranandTabriz. Pressuregradientsplay
a main role in providing convergence and updrafts. Conver-
genceisoneofthetriggermechanismsneededforproviding
upward motions, which are part of the foundation for thun-
derstorm formation. Even a very moist atmosphere cannot
produce strong thunderstorm development without a conver-
gence mechanism. In our cases, the role of the orographic
features clearly aids in preparing conditions for ascent. For
example,despitetheweakpressuregradient,thetopographic
conditions helped to form stormy weather at the Tehran and
Tabriz airports. The Sahand and Sabalan Mountains around
the city of Tabriz and the Alborz Mountains north of Tehran
(Fig. 1) have produced lifting forthunderstorm formation.The climatology of thunderstorm days in Iran shows that
statistically only a few stations have more than 50 days with
thunderstorms and that a slightly larger number of stations
have more than 30 days annually with thunderstorms. Be-
cause of this climatology, the country can be considered as
a region with a limited number of thunderstorm events. De-
spite the fact that most of these stations are not airport sta-
tions, the thunderstorm events are still considered important
becauseoftheriskstoﬂightoperationsassociatedwiththun-
derstorms. Therefore, we chose to investigate two impor-
tant regions for our case study: the Tehran station due to
its high number of ﬂights (more than 400 aircraft landing
and taking off daily) and the Tabriz station due to its rela-
tively high number of thunder days. The synoptic patterns
in this case study indicate relatively favourable conditions
for instability in Tehran. A surface pressure gradient, tem-
perature advection at 850hPa and the presence of cold air
in the upper levels provided suitable conditions for instabil-
ity in the lower layers of the atmosphere. The thermody-
namic diagrams for the Tabriz station show a shallow radia-
tion inversion at 00:00UTC that is indicative of stability at
very low levels. There was also no considerable moisture at
the station. In contrast, at 12:00UTC in the Tehran region,
no lower-level temperature inversion was observed, and the
moisture content was higher than at the Tabriz station. Be-
cause the moisture content that is observed at Tehran is still
not signiﬁcantly large, the thunderstorm intensity was mod-
erate to light. Two of the most important causes of severe
weather conditions are high humidity in the lower levels and
rising air; hence, these two parameters are the most impor-
tant NWP model output variables for thunderstorm forecast-
ing. In our study, humidity of more than 90% and a ver-
tical velocity equal to 1ms−1at 700hPa produced a rela-
tively severe thunderstorm in Tehran. Atmospheric instabil-
ity indices including KI and SI conﬁrmed a weak to mod-
erate thunderstorm in Tehran, while no thunderstorm was
forecast for Tabriz. These results are veriﬁed with observa-
tions. Haklander and Delden (2003) determined the thresh-
old values for important instability indices for the Nether-
lands using statistical methods and 32 different parameters
to determine the ability of those threshold values to forecast
thunderstorms. They found the following threshold values:
KI≥21◦C, LIsfc ≤1.6◦C, SHOW ≤4.2◦C, TT≥46.7◦C,
CAPE≥173JKg−1and SWEAT ≥134. A comparison of
the values of these indices with the two case studies in Iran
(Table 3) conﬁrms the occurrence and non-occurrence of
thunderstorms for the Tehran and Tabriz stations, respec-
tively.
Applying the Gordon checklist to the Tehran case study,
it was found that the answers to 6 of the 10 questions were
positive. This result indicates that the event is categorised in
the organised thunderstorm class. To determine the severity
of the thunderstorm event, the Miller checklist was used to
examine certain atmospheric parameters associated with the
event (Table 4). The table shows that the Tehran case may

be classiﬁed as a weak thunderstorm. In contrast, the event
that occurred at the Tabriz station was not placed into the
organisedclassofthunderstormsfoundintheGordoncheck-
list. Therefore, according to the Miller checklist, there was
no need to review the severity of the thunderstorm because
it was very weak. In fact, the Gordon and Miller check-
lists provide synoptic and mesoscale methods, respectively,
to study thunderstorm events using speciﬁc criteria that con-
sider all related parameters. If NWP models were conﬁg-
ured to answer the questions on the checklists, they could be
considered a good guide for forecasting thunderstorms and
determining their severity.
6 Conclusions
Atmospheric instability is a critical factor in determining
if thunderstorm development will commence. Certain pa-
rameters, including vertical motion and low-level moisture
content, are used to review and evaluate the atmosphericinstabilities that may lead to thunderstorm development. In
addition, climatological information concerning storm oc-
currence can aid in statistically determining the important
indicators and phenomena that create these storms. The cli-
matology of thunderstorm days in Iran shows that some me-
teorological stations in the western portion of the country
have thunderstorms on more than 30 days a year. This study
showedthatKI,LIandSIareappropriateindicatorsofinsta-
bility. We determined suitable threshold values for thunder-
stormsthatoccurredattheTehranandTabrizairportstations:
30◦CforKI, −2◦CforLIand −3◦CforSIareindicatorsof

locity from NWP models are the most important variables
for identifying atmospheric instability and can be consid-
ered proper tools to support thunderstorm forecasting. The
thresholdvaluesofrelativehumidityandverticalvelocityare
80% and 1ms−1, respectively. Additional tools, such as the
Gordon and Miller checklists, can help and guide weather
forecasters to predict thunderstorms. Although the threshold
