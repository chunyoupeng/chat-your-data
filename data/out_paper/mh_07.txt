Abstract
Aviation emissions impact surface air quality at multiple scales —from near-airport pollution peaks
associated with airport landing and take off (LTO) emissions, to intercontinental pollution attribu-
table to aircraft cruise emissions. Previous studies have quanti ﬁed aviation ’s air quality impacts
around a speci ﬁc airport, in a speci ﬁc region, or at the global scale. However, no study has assessed the
air quality and human health impacts of aviation, capturing effects on all aforementioned scales. Thisstudy uses a multi-scale modeling approach to quantify and monetize the air quality impact of civil
aviation emissions, approximating effects of aircraft plume dynamics-related local dispersion
(∼1 km), near-airport dispersion ( ∼10 km), regional ( ∼1000 km) and global ( ∼10 000 km) scale
chemistry and transport. We use concentration-response functions to estimate premature deaths dueto population exposure to aviation-attributable PM
2.5and ozone, ﬁnding that aviation emissions
cause∼16 000 (90% CI: 8300 –24 000) premature deaths per year. Of these, LTO emissions contribute
a quarter. Our estimate shows that premature deaths due to long-term exposure to aviation-attribu-
table PM 2.5and O 3lead to costs of ∼$21 bn per year. We compare these costs to other societal costs of
aviation and ﬁnd that they are on the same order of magnitude as global aviation-attributable climate
costs, and one order of magnitude larger than aviation-attributable accident and noise costs.
1. Introduction
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
estimates that the number of air passengers will morethan double in two decades, from 3.0 billion in 2012 to6.4 billion in 2030 (ICAO 2013 ). Aviation emissions
cause an increase in the concentration of pollutants
including ﬁne particulate matter (PM
2.5) and ozone
(O3). Epidemiological studies have reported that
exposure to PM 2.5and O 3is associated with an
increase in risk of premature death (Pope III et al2002 ,
Ostro 2004 , Laden et al 2006 , Pope III et al 2006 ,U S
EPA 2006 , Lewtas 2007 ). Aviation emissions impact
local, regional and global air quality (Segal and
Yamartino 1981 ,Y uet al2004 , Unal et al2005 , Carslaw
et al2006 , Farias and ApSimon 2006 , Peace et al2006 ,

Hsu et al2013 , Lee et al2013 , Rissman et al2013 , Yim
et al 2013 , Wolfe et al 2014 ). Previous studies have
partially quanti ﬁed aviation ’s air quality and resulting
health impacts from PM 2.5or O 3formation around
speciﬁc airports, for a speci ﬁc region, or on a global
level, respectively. However no attempt has previouslybeen made to quantify the global health burden
associated with aviation emissions, accounting for
near-airport, regional and global-scale effects.
PM
2.5has been linked to increased rates of lung
cancer as well as both cardiovascular and respiratory(cardiopulmonary) disease (Pope III et al2002 , Laden
et al2006 , Pope III et al2006 ). Epidemiological cohort
studies such as the Harvard Six Cities and AmericanCancer Society studies have demonstrated a statistical
link between PM
2.5exposure and mortality, while
clinical and laboratory studies have explored the phy-siological and molecular mechanisms that might be
involved. A review by the American Heart Association

© 2015 IOP Publishing Ltdfound that air pollutants are linked to a variety of phy-
siological responses which increase the likelihood of
fatal cardiovascular or respiratory incidents (Brooket al 2010 ). A follow up to the American Cancer
Society cohort study found that O
3, which has been
shown in animal laboratory studies to cause oxidativedamage when inhaled, is also linked to respiratory dis-
ease (Jerrett et al2009 ).
Barrett et al(2010 ) applied GEOS-Chem (at a glo-
bal scale) to estimate the concentration of PM
2.5due to
global aviation emissions. They reported that global
aircraft emissions cause ∼10 000 premature deaths per
year globally, with 80% due to cruise emissions. Lee
et al(2013 ) applied CAM-chem to study the impact of
aviation emissions on atmospheric O 3,N O yand PM 2.5
concentrations con ﬁrming the dominant role of cruise
emissions in aviation-attributable surface air quality
impacts. Woody et al(2011 ) quanti ﬁed aviation-attri-
butable ﬁne particulate matter emissions from landing
and takeoff (LTO) operations (i.e. below 3000 ft above
ground level) in the United States at 99 US airports in2005 and in 2025. Using results from Woody et al
(2011 ) and Levy et al (2012a ) calculated the resulting
human health impact from these LTO emissions to be75 premature deaths in 2005 and 460 in 2025.
A number of studies have assessed aviation sector
contributions to near-airport (<10 km) air qualitydegradation. Field and data analyses have demon-
strated a correlation between pollutant concentration
and aircraft activity at airports in the US (Segal andYamartino 1981 , Westerdahl et al 2008 , Dodson
et al2009 ,H u et al2009 , Hsu et al2012 , Hsu et al2013 ,
Zhu et al 2011 ), in Europe (Carslaw et al 2006 ,
Schürmann et al2007 , Carslaw and Beevers 2013 ) and
in Asia (Yu et al 2004 ). Local air quality modeling
approaches were also applied to quantify the near- ﬁeld
impact of airport emissions (Farias and ApSi-
mon 2006 , Peace et al2006 , Carslaw and Taylor 2009 ,
Carslaw et al 2012 ). These studies only investigated a
limited number of airports and typically focused on
primary pollutants (directly emitted from sources),
but not secondary pollutants (formed through chemi-
cal reactions). One exception in terms of pollutants
considered is Arunachalam et al(2011 ), who used the
Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ) to
estimate the population exposure to both primary and
secondary PM
2.5concentrations at three US airports,
applying three grid resolutions of 36 km, 12 km and
4 km. Rissman et al(2013 ) used a modi ﬁed version of
CMAQ with a plume-in-grid model to estimate thePM
2.5concentration due to emissions at Harts ﬁeld–
Jackson Atlanta International Airport. However, Yim
et al (2013 ) show that the variation of air quality
impacts around airports is ﬁner than the resolutions
applied in the two aforementioned studies. To capture
the variation of local impacts associated with aviationemissions, Yim et al(2013 ) applied CMAQ and a local
dispersion model to quantify the air quality and health
impacts due to the LTO emissions of 20 major airportsin the United Kingdom. By merging both regional and
local air quality models results, Yim et al (2013 ) esti-
mated that the current UK aviation emissions cause∼110 premature deaths per year. Yim et al (2013 )
found that accounting for local scale dispersion at the
sub-grid scale increases estimated PM exposure by25–31%, but this increase was halved when account-
ing for plume dynamics (Barrett et al2013 ). Kim et al
(2012 ) employed a hybrid modeling approach using
CMAQ and the AERMOD dispersion model to com-
bine the spatially-diffuse secondary PM
2.5impacts
with localized impacts of primary PM 2.5pollutants
from the Washington Dulles airport. (See section 2.6
of Kim et al2012 for further airport-speci ﬁc studies).
Another important factor is the level of backgroundammonia. As noted by Barrett et al(2010 ), the major-
ity of aviation-attributable PM
2.5at surface level is sec-
ondary inorganic PM 2.5formed from neutralization of
NH 4+with either SO 42−or NO 3−. Broadly, this is limited
by either the available ammonia, from which NH 4+is
formed, or the total available sulfate and nitrate ions.High levels of background ammonia therefore result
in production of PM
2.5in the presence of either SO xor
NO xaerosol precursors.
Most existing studies focused on the impact of
aviation on PM, while only a limited number of stu-
dies investigated the impact of aviation emissions onsurface ozone. Unal et al (2005 ) applied CMAQ to
simulate PM
2.5and ozone formation due to the emis-
sions of Atlanta Harts ﬁeld–Jackson International Air-
port at a ten-day period. Köhler et al (2013 ) and
Skowron et al (2013 ) investigated long-term ozone
concentration due to aviation emissions, but only inrelation to climate impacts.
In this paper, we estimate the concentration of
both PM
2.5and ozone attributable to aviation emis-
sions, by approximating effects of aircraft plume
dynamics-related local dispersion ( ∼1 km), near-air-
port dispersion ( ∼10 km), and regional ( ∼1000 km)
and global ( ∼10 000 km) scale chemistry and trans-
port. In this way we capture the impact of cruise emis-
sions, which take effect on a global to regional scale,
and the impact of LTO emissions, which have an
impact on a local to regional scale. We estimate theresulting health impact in terms of premature mor-
talities, monetize this impact and quantify uncertain-
ties. To inform understanding of the relativeimportance of the health impact of aviation-attribu-
table PM
2.5and O 3concentrations, we compare the
health costs to other societal costs of aviation. In parti-cular, we consider (i) climate costs, which result from
aviation combustion emissions and measure global
welfare losses caused by aviation-induced increases inglobal surface temperature (e.g. higher ﬂooding risks
or lower agricultural productivity), (ii) accident costs
in terms of the economic value, which is assigned toinjuries and mortalities in aviation accidents, and (iii)
noise costs as derived from aviation-related losses in
property values. This is the ﬁrst study to assess the
2Environ. Res. Lett. 10(2015) 034001 S H L Yim et alglobal health impacts of aviation including effects at a
near-airport to global scale, and the ﬁrst to show that
the human health costs of aviation are comparable toits climate costs.
2. Methods
We apply a multi-scale approach to resolve thevariation of aviation-attributable PM
2.5and ozone at
different spatial scales. Global and regional air quality
impacts are estimated using chemistry-transportmodels GEOS-Chem and CMAQ, with aviation-attributable PM
2.5and ozone computed as the differ-
ence between simulations with all emissions andsimulations where only non-aviation emissions areincluded. Airport vicinity impacts of PM
2.5(but not
ozone, which is regional in nature) are calculated bymerging the results of both local dispersion andregional chemistry-transport models. Prematuredeaths due to long-term exposure to PM
2.5and ozone
attributable to aviation emissions are calculated usingpopulation density data to compute exposure, andthen mapping exposure to risk of early death usingconcentration-response functions (CRFs). Country-speciﬁc values of statistical life (VSL) are calculated to
monetize the resultant premature deaths. We use a
Monte –Carlo approach to quantify the uncertainties
in our calculations.
2.1. Aviation emissions
Aviation emissions for 2006 are from AEDT (Wilk-
erson et al 2010 ) and include civil aviation emissions
of NO
x, hydrocarbons, and fuel burn. Emissions of
SOx, black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) are
scaled from fuel burn per Barrett et al (2012 ).
Speci ﬁcally, we assume a scaling factor of 30 mg kg−1
fuel for BC and OC, which is comparable with results
from the Aircraft Particle Emissions Experimentmeasurement campaigns which have found a range of37–83 mg kg
−1fuel for OC and 21 –98 mg kg−1fuel for
BC (Kinsey 2009 ). Total global fuel burn is estimated
to be 188 Tg, of which 36% occurs in North America,25% in Europe and 20% in Asia. The remaining 19%occurs in other regions (including Africa and Ocea-nia). Emissions are gridded spatially and temporallyfor air quality modeling.
Local air quality in the vicinity of a total of 968 air-
ports is explicitly modeled, accounting for 94% of the
total fuel burn consumption for aircraft taxi-in and
out, takeoff and landing. Of the modeled airports,26.5%, 22.9%, 19.1% are located in North America,Europe, Asia, respectively. The remaining airportsmodeled are in other regions. We note that we do notinclude impacts occurring at many smaller airports,which are also likely to have local-scale impacts. 69%of airports are within the three CMAQ regions, whichcapture 65% of the global population, 70% of full-ﬂight aviation fuel burn, and 76% of LTO fuel burn. Alist of the airports is provided in section 3in the
Electronic Supporting Information (ESI) available
atstacks.iop.org/ERL/10/034001/mmedia . Aircraft
ground primary particulate matter emissions (BC, OC
and primary sulfate) are computed and assigned to
runways, terminals and taxiways according to ﬂight
modes including taxi-in and out, takeoff and landing.
For airports in the United States, the emissions are
assigned to terminals and runways according to the
AEDT airport database (AEDT 2011 ). For non-US air-
ports, all operation emissions are assigned to runways,since taxiway and terminal data were not broadly
available. (Applying the same approach to the US
resulted in a <5% local exposure difference relative tohaving terminal area information.)
2.2. Air quality modeling
We apply a multi-scale approach to resolve the air
quality impacts on three scales: global, regional and
local. We use GEOS-Chem (Bey et al 2001 ), a global
chemistry-transport model with a spatial resolution of
4° × 5°, to simulate global air quality. GEOS-Chem
results provide boundary conditions for the regionalchemistry-transport model, CMAQ (Byun and
Schere 2006 ), to simulate the air quality in North
America, Europe and Asia, with a spatial resolution of
36 km, 40.5 km and 50 km, respectively. For areas
outside of these three high resolution regions, GEOS-Chem results are used.
GEOS5 meteorological data from NASA are used
to drive GEOS-Chem. We use the Weather Researchand Forecast (WRF) (Skamarock and Klemp 2008 )t o
simulate meteorological ﬁelds for the CMAQ simula-
tions. Six-hour reanalysis data are used to provideinitial and boundary conditions for WRF. For the
regions of North America and Asia, the Final Opera-
tional Global Analysis (NCEP 1999 ) data are used. For
the European region, the European Center for Med-
ium range Weather Forecasting (Dee et al2011 ) fore-
cast data are used.
Non-aviation emissions in GEOS-Chem (i.e. as
used for the global simulation providing boundaryconditions for the three high resolution regions and
results for other regions) are described in Bey et al
(2001 ), as updated. Non-aviation emissions in CMAQ
simulations for North America, Europe and Asia are
described in Caiazzo et al (2013 ), in Yim and Barrett
(2012 ), and in the section 2in the SI, respectively.
We apply the Rapid Dispersion Code (RDC) (Bar-
rett and Britter 2008 ,2009 ) to simulate the local air
quality impacts of aircraft ground level emissions. The
RDC is based on the approaches described in Barrett
and Britter ( 2008 ,2009 ) that map point-source dis-
persion calculations to area sources semi-analytically.
The RDC reduces the computational time of simula-
tions with multi-area emission sources by 99.5% with
a∼
5% error in mean concentrations (Lee 2012 ). The
RDC has been used by Lee ( 2012 ) and Yim and Barrett
3Environ. Res. Lett. 10(2015) 034001 S H L Yim et al(2012 ) to evaluate air quality impacts due to airport
emissions. The spatial resolution of RDC grid recep-
tors is 400 m with a domain size of 40.4 km × 40.4 km.AERMOD (Cimorelli et al2004 ) is used to provide the
parameterization of a point source dispersion required
by RDC for area source computations, as are used torepresent runways and terminal areas. The meteor-
ological data (upper air soundings and surface obser-
vations) required by AERMOD, are provided by theIntegrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA) oper-
ated by the National Climatic Data Center
(NCDC 2008 ). The RDC results are compared against
results calculated by AERMOD (Cimorelli et al2004 )
in Lee ( 2012 ).
In addition to computing primary PM concentra-
tions in the vicinity of airports, we use an approach
described in Lewis and Stevens ( 1985 ) to estimate the
local concentrations of secondary sulfate PM
2.5due to
aircraft ground emissions as follows. The secondary
sulfate concentration is estimated as
χχ ε =+− kxu1,SO SO x 42⎛
⎝⎜⎞
⎠⎟
where χSOxis the total concentration of sulfur oxides
on a common mass basis simulated by RDC to account
for dispersion; εis the percentage of fuel sulfur emitted
as sulfate (assumed to be 2%) (Stettler et al2011 );kis
the average SO 2transformation rate to SO 42−(assumed
to be 1% h−1) (Lewis and Stevens 1985 );xis the
distance from the emission source; andu1is the
temporal average of the inverse of wind speed over
a year.
We merged the RDC results with the CMAQ
results for airports in the three regions considered at a
regional scale (North America, Europe and Asia) and
with the GEOS-Chem results for other airports. To
avoid double counting the impact of aircraft emis-
sions, we apply a mass-conserving approach devel-oped by Isakov et al (2007 ). The PM concentration
used for exposure assessment is
χχ χ χ=+ − ,RDC CMAQ RDC
where χis the concentration ( μgm–3) of aviation-
attributable PM 2.5merged from the results of both
RDC and CMAQ models ( μgm–3), which is referred
to as local/regional hybrid results; χRDCis the PM 2.5
concentration ( μgm–3) calculated by RDC; χCMA Qis
the aviation-attributable PM 2.5 concentration
μ(g m)–3simulated by CMAQ; χRDCis the RDC
PM 2.5concentration averaged over all the RDC grid
cells in a CMAQ grid cell. This method has beenapplied in other airport studies (Lee 2012 , Yim
et al 2013 ) and has the effect of conserving ground-
level PM mass, but redistributing it to be closer tosources using local dispersion model results.
2.3. Plume correction factor and source modeling
Aircraft taxi, takeoff and landing roll emission sources
are modeled as ground level area sources per Barrettet al (2013 ), who found that if the aircraft plume
dynamics were not taken into account, the simulated
concentration in the near- ﬁeld from an area source
would be over-predicted by a factor of 1.36 –2.30. This
over-prediction is caused by neglecting the additional
mixing due to aircraft exhaust jet mixing and buoy-ancy. Barrett et al(2013 ) showed that area sources can
parameterize the local dispersion of aircraft sources if
multiplied by a plume correction factor. We thereforetake the plume correction factor into account in our
calculations. Elevated sources, which occur in the
higher speed winds away from the ground and arespread out due to the speed of airborne aircraft, are
captured in CMAQ (and GEOS-Chem) modeling and
not local dispersion modeling.
2.4. Health impacts
2.4.1. CRF for PM
2.5
PM 2.5exposure is estimated by overlaying the avia-
tion-attributable PM 2.5 concentrations, pieced
together from the GEOS-Chem global simulation, the
three CMAQ regional simulations, and the 968 disper-
sion computations, onto population taken from theGlobal Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMPv1)
with a spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds
(GRUMP 2011 ). The resultant premature deaths are
estimated using CRFs reported by the WHO
(WHO 2004 ). While this CRF is older than alternative
CRFs reported in the literature, we select it because itprovides for direct comparison to similar studies and
exhibits the property of reducing risk at higher
exposure and thus may provide a more representativeburden of disease estimate for developing countries,
where a higher background pollutant concentration is
expected (Barrett et al2012 ). We present results for an
alternate CRF and also discuss the impact of other
CRF choices in the ESI.
The WHO CRF describes the relationships
between annual average PM
2.5exposure and the risk of
premature death due to lung cancer and cardio-
pulmonary disease. The CRF takes the form

Bkis the baseline incidence rate for each disease based
on the WHO Global Burden of Disease (GBD)(WHO 2004 ) database,
Pkis population above 30 years
of age which is exposed to PM 2.5, and kis a population
exposure grid cell index. Further information on data
sources is provided in section 6 in the ESI. We notethat the toxicity may be different among PM
2.5species.
However, since the differential toxicities are uncertain
(Levy et al2012b ), we assume an equal toxicity for all
4Environ. Res. Lett. 10(2015) 034001 S H L Yim et alPM 2.5species in the premature death estimation
consistent with EPA practice and previous studies.
2.4.2. CRF for ozone (O 3)
We apply a log-linear CRF to estimate premature
deaths due to long-term exposure to aviation-attribu-
table ozone (Jerrett et al2009 ). The CRF has previously
been used in assessments of health impacts due to
ozone exposure (US EPA 2011 , Fann et al 2012 ).
Premature mortality due to aviation-attributableozone exposure is estimated as
βΔ=⋅ −
⋅()y
Opremature deaths 11
exp,0
3⎛
⎝⎜
⎜⎞
⎠⎟
⎟
where y0represents the baseline incidence rate (deaths
due to all respiratory diseases). ΔO3is the averaged
daily maximum ozone concentration (ppb) due to
aviation emissions. We note that while this is strictlyapplicable during the ozone season, we take the annual
average daily maximum ozone perturbation due to
aviation emissions because of the relatively smallimpact of aviation, the variability of the ozone season
in different regions, and because application of this
approach to the US results in a <10% error. While thisis small relative to other sources of uncertainty, we
correct for this in our uncertainty quanti ﬁcation
approach.
2.5. Valuation
We monetize premature deaths due to aviation emis-
sions. The valuation is based on the VSL distribution
reported by the US EPA ( 2011 ) with a mean of $7.4 m
(in 2006US$). A Weibull distribution is applied to ﬁt
the data with a scale parameter of 7.75 and a shape
parameter of 1.51 according to US EPA (2012). Weestimate the VSLs for other countries based on their
gross national income and an income elasticity range
of 1–2 (Hammitt and Robinson 2011 ) as in Barrett
et al (2012 ). Our valuation estimation also takes into
account a 20-year cessation lag for PM
2.5impacts (US
EPA 2011 ) so that 30% of the total premature deaths
occur in the ﬁrst year, 50% occur equally in years two
toﬁve and the remaining 20% occur equally in years
six to 20. The cessation lag is not applied for O 3health
impacts due to a lack of evidence to support any
cessation lag structure. We estimate the net present
value of damage at discount rates of 2%, 3% and 7%.
To compare the resulting health costs to other
societal costs of aviation, we provide cost estimates ofglobal accident costs, global climate costs and global
noise costs of aviation. We derive global noise costs
from He et al (2014 ). Climate costs are estimated
based on the results in Dorbian et al(2011 ). For acci-
dent costs, we conduct our own analysis based on acci-
dent, fatality and injury statistics. The methodologyemployed for calculating consistent cost estimates is
described in section 11 in the ESI.2.6. Uncertainty
The concentration results, which we discuss in the
result section, are nominal values from model simula-
tions, while premature deaths are shown as a centralestimate with 90% con ﬁdence intervals. Similar to
Yim et al(2013 ) and Yim and Barrett ( 2012 ), we apply
a Monte –Carlo approach to assess uncertainty in
premature death and valuation estimates. Uncertaintyassociated with atmospheric modeling and the CRFs
are taken into account in the calculations. A triangular
distribution —deﬁned by low, nominal and high
multipliers —is assumed except where otherwise spe-
ciﬁed. The uncertainties of simulated PM
2.5and O 3
vary for both GEOS-Chem and CMAQ for different
regions. The uncertainty distributions for the twomodels are based on the normalized mean biasobtained from model validation exercises. Uncertain-
ties in AERMOD-computed concentrations are repre-
sented by a T(0.5, 1, 1.5), i.e. a ±50% triangularly
distributed uncertainty (Chang and Hanna 2004 ),
while the additional uncertainties of RDC are repre-
sented by T(0.9, 1, 1.1) based on validation results
provided in Lee ( 2012 ). The potential reduction in
aircraft-attributable concentrations due to aircraft
plume mixing and buoyancy are represented by a
factor with a distribution T(0.58, 0.71, 0.88) (Barrett
et al2013 ).
Stettler et al (2013 ) reported that the methods
which have been widely used to estimate aircraft BCemissions (FOA3 for LTO emissions and ﬂeet average
EIs for cruise emissions), may result in an under-
estimation of BC emissions during LTO cycle and atcruise by a factor of T(1.99, 3.97, 5.96) and T(2.70,
2.93, 3.28), respectively (Stettler et al2013 ). A sensitiv-
ity analysis is performed to estimate the sensitivity of
the health impact results to different BC emission cal-culations, including the current widely-used method,
FOA3, and FOX as developed by Stettler et al (2013 ).
This is discussed in section 10 of the ESI.
For the WHO-CRF, the uncertainties of cardio-
pulmonary diseases and lung cancer baseline inci-
dences are represented by T(0.06, 0.16, 0.25) and T
(0.09, 0.23, 0.38), respectively (Ostro 2004 ). For the
ozone-CRF, the relative risk is represented by the dis-
tribution T(1.010. 1.040, 1.067) as reported by Jerrett
et al (2009 ). A factor of 0.9 is taken to represent the
over-estimation due to averaging the daily maximum
ozone concentration over a year instead of over ozone
season.
The uncertainty in the VSL for the US is repre-
sented by a Weibull distribution with a mean of $7.4 m(in 2006US$) as described in section 2.5 (US
EPA 2011 ), while the uncertainty of the VSLs for other
countries are based on the uncertainty found in litera-
ture. A list of the VSLs and their uncertainty ranges isprovided in the section 7 in the ESI.

Weﬁrst describe results for global and regional air
quality impacts, then computations of near-airport air
quality. Air quality impacts accounting for all scales
are then mapped to health impacts and monetized to
enable comparison with other societal costs of
aviation.
3.1. Global and regional air quality impacts
Table 1shows the global (GEOS-Chem and CMAQ
based) and regional (CMAQ based) surface PM and
ozone impacts of aviation, with PM impacts speciated.
The impact of LTO emissions (i.e. up to 3000 ft) is also
given, as these are the emissions that are currently
regulated.
The global average impact of aviation emissions on
surface O 3is 0.6 ppb. This result is consistent with Lee
et al(2013 ), which reports that aviation emissions lead
to 0.5 ppb increase in O 3in July, whereas up to several
ppb in January. Our estimate show that 2% (10.7 ppt)
of the total aviation impact on surface O 3is attribu-
table to LTO emissions. Compared with the results
calculated by only using GEOS-Chem, the global area-
weighted ground level O 3attributable to full ﬂight
aviation emissions when including nested CMAQ
computations increases by 12%, but the O 3impact
due to LTO emissions decreases by 6%, consistent
with increased NO xemissions decreasing O 3forma-
tion in VOC limited regions (which are captured by
the higher resolution CMAQ modeling).
Among the regions, North America experiences
the highest aviation impact on surface O 3(1.1 ppb), of
which LTO emissions contribute for 25.4 ppt. Avia-
tion emissions cause a 0.9 ppb increase in annual aver-
age O 3concentration in Asia, which is lower than the
impact in Europe and North America. In Europe, the
O3impact due to LTO emissions is ∼2.4 times higher
than that in Asia. The aviation-attributable O 3con-
centration in other regions is ∼0.5 ppb.
We estimate that global aviation emissions result
in an average 6.2 ng m−3ground level PM 2.5perturba-
tion. Figure 1depicts the annual ground level PM 2.5
concentration due to aviation emissions, where
GEOS-Chem and CMAQ results have been merged.
Compared with the results calculated by only usingGEOS-Chem, the global area-weighted ground level
aviation-attributable PM 2.5decreases by 29%, while
the standard deviation of the concentration increases
by 22%, representing increased spatial resolution.
Our estimates show two peaks of PM 2.5in North-
ern India (0.47 μgm−3) and Northeastern China
(0.35 μgm−3), coincident with peaks in ammonia
concentrations (Barrett et al 2010 ), and also peaks in
the central Europe and San Francisco, which are asso-
ciated with major airports. Of the total ground level
aviation-attributable PM 2.5, nitrate (NO 3−) and sulfate
(SO 42–) account for 42% and 38% by mass, respec-
tively. BC and OC together account for ∼1% on aver-
age. As seen in table 1, aviation has a negative impact
on OC in North America and Europe. Aircraft NO x
emissions have been shown to reduce ambient OC
(Ashok et al2013 , Woody and Arunachalam 2013 ), as
they deplete radical species in the vicinity of airports
and consequently slow the oxidation of organic aero-
sol precursors (Woody and Arunachalam 2013 ).
Woody and Arunachalam ( 2013 ) note, however, that
aviation ’s impact on OC may be sensitive to model
grid resolution.
Our global and regional models results show that
the air quality impact due to aviation emissions varies
among the different regions. In North America,
9.0 ng m−3of PM 2.5is attributable to aviation emis-
sions. Of the aviation-attributable PM 2.5in North
America, ∼13% (1.2 ng m−3) is due to LTO emissions.
In Europe, the annual average PM 2.5due to aviation
emissions is 18.2 ng m−3, which is the highest among
the regions, and is double of that of North America. In
Asia and other regions, the average PM 2.5concentra-
tions due to aviation emissions are 15.1 ng m−3and
3.8 ng m−3, respectively. As can be seen in ﬁgure 1,i n
the other regions (not modeled at high resolution with
CMAQ), aviation contributes to PM 2.5in limited
regions including the Middle East and western parts of
Russia.
3.2. Local air quality impact in different regions
We estimate the near-airport (within 20 km) ground
level aviation-attributable PM 2.5averaged over all
airports in each region, combining our local disper-
sion calculations with CMAQ results using the mass
conserving scheme described. Our results show thatTable 1. The mean ground level concentrations of PM 2.5(ng m–3) and O 3due to full ﬂight (FF) and landing and takeoff (LTO) only emis-
sions. The global values are based on CMAQ results for the three regions and GEOS-Chem results for other regions, and GEOS-Chemreplaced CMAQ where available for global results. The percentage of each PM
2.5species is also given for full ﬂight emissions.

6Environ. Res. Lett. 10(2015) 034001 S H L Yim et alprimary PM 2.5due to aviation emissions contributes
to 44–61% of total aviation-attributable PM 2.5at 2 km
distance from airports. However, the percentagedecreases as distance from airport increases. At 20 km
from airports, the percentage drops to less than 6%.
Our results show that aviation emissions lead to an
average PM
2.5concentration of 44.2 ng m−3in the
20 km vicinity of all airports globally. For airports in
Asia, the mean near- ﬁeld impact of PM 2.5due to avia-
tion emissions is 74.1 ng m−3, the highest among
regions and more than double as the PM 2.5in North
America (29.5 ng m−3). This is consistent with the
peak in available ammonia amplifying aviation ’s
PM 2.5contribution, particularly the effect of cruise
emissions. On average, the mean aviation-attributable
PM 2.5impacts in the vicinity of airports in Europe and
in other regions are 58.5 ng m−3and 26.2 ng m−3,
respectively.
The population exposure to aviation-attributable
PM 2.5in different regions varies due to different regio-
nal population densities in the vicinity of airports, the
variation in available ammonia and in aviation emis-sions. Our results show that 23% of airports have near-
ﬁeld population exposure to aircraft-attributable
PM
2.5higher than the global average exposure, of
which 17% are located in North America, 33% and
34% are located in Europe and Asia, respectively, andthe remaining 16% are located in other regions. Avia-
tion emissions result in 44.9 people·mg m–3mean
PM 2.5exposure within 20 km averaged over all air-
ports globally. Among regions, the mean exposure inthe vicinity of airports in Asia is the highest (142.6people·mg m
–3per year), a factor of ∼3.2 higher than
the global average. The relatively high near- ﬁeld PM 2.5
exposure in Asia is due to this region having both rela-
tively high aviation-attributable PM 2.5concentration
(due to the extent of available ammonia) and meanpopulation density in the vicinity of airports. Within20 km of airports, the average population surroundingall airports in Asia is 1.6 million, 87% higher than theglobal average. The average aviation-attributablePM
2.5exposure within 20 km of airports in Europe,
North America and other regions is 42.3, 19.5 and 15.3people·mg m
–3, respectively.
3.3. Health impacts
Table 2shows estimated premature mortalities due to
aviation emissions. Global aviation emissions cause
16 000 (90% CI: 8300 –24 000) premature deaths per
year due to population exposure to aviation-attribu-table PM
2.5and ozone. Of the total premature deaths,
87% and 13% are due to PM 2.5and ozone, respec-
tively, while 25% is attributable to the LTO portion ofemissions. Comparing with the approach of only using

7Environ. Res. Lett. 10(2015) 034001 S H L Yim et alGEOS-Chem (a global model), our multi-scale
approach estimates 7% and 29% higher global pre-
mature deaths due to full ﬂight and LTO emissions,
respectively. The lower increase for full ﬂight emis-
sions is consistent with the relatively diffuse impact of
the dominant cruise emissions being captured by the
lower resolution global model.
Our estimate shows that aviation emissions cause
2100 (90% CI: 1000 –3300) ozone-related premature
deaths per year worldwide. LTO emissions aloneaccount for 2.6% of the ozone-associated premature
deaths due to aviation emissions. This result highlights
that the long-term health impact of O
3due to LTO
aviation emissions is marginal, compared to the PM 2.5
health impact. However, the ozone-exposure due tofullﬂight emissions accounts for 12% of the total pre-
mature deaths due to the both aviation-attributablePM
2.5and O 3. Of the total ozone health impact due to
aviation emissions, 62% occurs in Asia, while 7% and
10% occurs in North America and Europe, respec-tively. From table 1it can be seen that the O
3mixing
ratio attributable to aviation in the three regions is
0.9–1.1 ppb, suggesting that population density drives
the breakdown of mortalities by region. The remain-ing 21% occurs in other regions.
In Barrett et al (2010 ), it is found that 80% of
health impacts on a global scale are due to non-LTO
emissions. In this study with its increased regional
resolution combined with dispersion calculations at968 airports, we capture more of the LTO impacts(partly countered by the inclusion of ozone in this
study which is dominated by cruise emissions) and
revise this estimate down to 75%. However, as shownin table 2, regions with relatively high concentrations
of airport fuel burn have relatively high contributions
from LTO emissions. Speci ﬁcally, in North America
and Europe 43% and 49% of early deaths are due toLTO emissions, respectively. On the other hand, 91%
of early deaths in Asia are due to non-LTO emissions.
Asia accounts for 20% of global civil aviation fuelburn, but over 50% of early deaths due to aviation
emissions. This is consistent with Asia incurring a rela-
tively high component of intercontinental air pollu-tion from aviation (Koo et al 2013 ). In other words,
the prominence of Asia is due to population density
and the amplifying effect of available ammonia on
nitrate rather than local LTO emissions (whichcontribute little to nitrate exposure due to the time-
scale required for oxidation of NO
x).
While ﬁgure 1would suggest that the majority of
aviation ’s air quality impacts are captured in the three
high resolution regions, table 1shows that ∼2700 early
deaths occur in the other regions due to aviation emis-sions each year, greater than the ∼1500 in North
America. The ratio of total population exposure toPM
2.5due to aviation emissions for North America to
other regions is 0.53, whereas the ratio of population-weighted average PM
2.5concentration due to aviation
emissions for North America to other regions is 4.05.This is consistent with the major air quality impacts ofaviation being captured in the high resolution regions,while the population in other regions means that thediffuse impacts of aviation still contribute 17% of glo-
bal early deaths.
We calculate premature deaths due to aviation-
attributable PM
2.5exposure within 20 km from each
airport worldwide. Our results show that aviation-attributable PM
2.5causes 5000 (90% CI: 2000 –9900)
premature deaths within 20 km from ∼1000 airports,
which account for ∼32% of the total premature deaths
due to both aviation-attributable PM 2.5and O 3. Of the
total airport vicinity premature deaths (i.e. thosewithin 20 km of airports), 25% occur in North Amer-ica; 38% in Europe; 22% in Asia; and the remaining15% in other regions. We do not detail early deaths inthe vicinity of each individual airport because impactsare calculated for aviation in general and not speci ﬁc
airports, so impacts within 20 km of a speci ﬁc airport
cannot be attributed to that airport.
3.4. Valuation and comparison to other societal cost
of aviationWe monetize the premature deaths due to aviationemissions (in 2006 US$). The central monetizedhealth impact is $(21.16, 20.58, 18.72)bn per year for a(2, 3, 7)% discount rate choice (ESI table S16). Of thetotal cost, the damage in North America accounts for
$(7.08, 6.89, 6.27)bn per year, the damage in Europe
amounts to $(10.02, 9.74, 8.82)bn per year —the
highest among the different regions —while the
damage in Asia is $(2.25, 2.19, 2.00)bn per year. Thedamage in other regions accounts for the remaining$(1.48, 1.44, 1.32)bn per year.
Table 3shows that the resulting regional health
cost of aviation emissions is not proportional toTable 3. Aviation fuel burn (FB) in different regions and the resultant costs (2006US$bn) for a 2% discount rate due to the health impact of
aviation full ﬂight and LTO emissions. This table also includes the ratio of health costs to aviation fuel burn occurring in each region.

8Environ. Res. Lett. 10(2015) 034001 S H L Yim et alaviation fuel burn occurring in each region. The global
average ratio is US$112/tonne for full- ﬂight emissions
and the ﬁgure for LTO emissions is a factor of 3.31
higher. The corresponding factor for number of early
deaths per unit fuel burn is 2.13. LTO operations causemore early deaths per unit emission than at cruise dueto the proximity of emissions to the population. How-ever, when monetized this difference is magni ﬁed due
to the relatively greater importance of LTO emissions
in richer regions (with higher VSLs) such as NorthAmerica. The in ﬂuence of regional variation in VSL is
also evident in noting that while 51% of full- ﬂight
aviation emissions-attributable early deaths occur inAsia, only 11% of monetized impacts occur there.
Dorbian et al(2011 ) estimated that the air quality
marginal damages per tonne of fuel burn in LTO in theUnited States is US$230, which is ∼50% lower than
our result of US$439. This may be because Dorbianet al (2011 ) used a regional air quality model only,
which does not resolve local impacts, and FOA3-based
BC emissions rather than the higher FOX-based BCemissions.
To understand the relative importance of health
costs due to the air quality impact of aviation emis-
sions, we compare them to the estimates of other avia-
tion-induced societal costs, i.e. noise costs, accidentcosts and climate change costs as shown in ﬁgure 2.
(See ESI for the monetization approach.) The ﬁgure
compares the central values for global health costs due
to the air quality impact of aviation emissions in 2006
with estimates for climate costs, accident costs andnoise costs for the same year and various discountrates, where applicable. Note that the bars shown here
are based on mid- or mean estimates and that sig-
niﬁcant uncertainty exists about actual costs, as indi-
cated by the error bars in this ﬁgure.
Our results show that the health costs of aviation
emissions are on the same order of magnitude com-
pared to climate costs for discount rates of 2% and 3%.
For a consistent discount rate of 7%, climate costs are
one order of magnitude smaller than health costs.
Comparing the emissions-related health costs to the
global accident costs of aviation, the central estimate
of the health costs exceed the mid accident costs esti-mate by one order of magnitude. Aircraft accidents
have a high public visibility but are rare occurrences
(∼0.4 fatal accidents per million hours ﬂown, for a
total of ∼1050 fatalities in 2006, see ESI section 11),
but the societal costs as calculated here are sig-
niﬁcantly lower than the health costs of aviation emis-
sions. We also ﬁnd that the mean estimate of the
annualized noise costs is one order of magnitude lower
than the central values for the health costs due to avia-tion emissions.
4. Conclusions
We produce the ﬁrst multi-scale global assessment of
the air quality and human health impacts of aviation,
accounting for both ﬁne particulate matter and ozone,
estimating that aviation emissions result in ∼16 000
early deaths each year. We ﬁnd that PM 2.5exposure
causes 87% of early deaths. While cruise emissions
dominate causing 75% of early deaths due to aviation
Figure 2. Comparison of the central net present value cost estimate for 2006 aviation emissions-related health costs with mid net
present value cost estimates for climate impacts from aviation emissions, mid cost estimates for accident costs of aviation and mean
annualized aviation noise costs (2006US$bn), differentiated according to discount rates (DRs), where applicable. The capitalized
mean noise costs are added for reference. The error bar for health costs is bounded by the 5% and 95% percentile of monetizedimpacts. See the section 11 in the ESI for details on error bars for the other costs.
9Environ. Res. Lett. 10(2015) 034001 S H L Yim et alemissions, approximately half of early deaths are
caused by LTO emissions in North America and
Europe —regions with relatively high aviation and
airport fuel burn. In contrast, 91% of early deaths are
caused by non-LTO emissions in Asia. This suggests
that LTO emissions reductions in North America andEurope will provide regional bene ﬁts, while the
beneﬁts of non-LTO emissions reductions will be
diffuse and also felt in Asia.
A global total of ∼5000 people who live within
20 km of airports are estimated to die prematurely
each year due to aviation emissions, with 38% of air-port vicinity early deaths in Europe. Our results sug-
gest, in contrast with previous analyses, that primary
PM
2.5emissions from aviation are a signi ﬁcant con-
tributor to health risk when airport vicinity exposure
is captured. A signi ﬁcant uncertainty in our estimates
of the subgrid contribution to PM 2.5exposure is the
aviation BC emissions inventory.
Finally we show that the monetized health costs of
aviation emissions exceed aviation ’s fatal accident
costs and noise costs by an order of magnitude, and is
on the same order as aviation ’s climate costs for dis-
count rates of 2% and 3% (as are appropriate to cli-mate change costing Johnson and Hope 2012 ). This
suggests that environmental bene ﬁts of fuel burn
reductions are as much in air quality as they are in cli-mate. Furthermore, this implies that when assessing
the environmental impacts of aviation biofuels that
result in reductions in emissions, the air qualityimpacts may be in the same order as the climate
impacts. For example, paraf ﬁnic biofuels would be
expected to eliminate SO
xemissions and reduce BC
emissions by ∼80% (Speth et al2015 ).
