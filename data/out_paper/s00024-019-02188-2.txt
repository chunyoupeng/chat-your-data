Aviation Meteorology: Observations and Models. Introduction
ISMAIL GULTEPE1,2and W AYNE F. F ELTZ3
This special issue of Pure and Applied Geophysics contains an introduction plus 14 papers related toAviation Meteorology . The papers cover important topics such as wind, gust, turbulence, visibility rela- ted to fog and precipitation, convection and lightning, icing, and high ice water content and engine icing.
These research areas are important to develop appli- cations for aviation meteorology, and in particular, aviation operations. The results discussed in this special issue are generated by research efforts con- ducted internationally, and include several review papers. Review papers on aviation meteorology
(Gultepe et al. 2019a ), gravity waves and convec- tively-induced turbulence (Sharman and Trier 2019 ), lidars (Thobois et al. 2019 ), and geostationary satel- lites (Ellrod and Pryor 2019 ), as well as supersite observations (Gultepe et al. 2019b ) provided exten- sive details for operational applications. Some of these papers were included in various international conferences, including the EGU (European Geo- physical Union) aviation meteorology sessions, that took place in Vienna, Austria, during 2016–2018.
Aviation meteorology covers many interrelated subjects and engineering topics. These include ground-based operations that are related to adverse effect of frost, ice, snow, and visibility on aircraft performance and in-ﬂight icing and turbulence. The effects of these on aircraft are decreased thrust andlift, increased drag, increased stall speed, and modi-
ﬁed handling characteristics (TC AIM 2019 ; Bragg et al. 2000 ). TC AIM report suggested that the type of frost, ice or snow, that can accumulate on an aircraft, while on the ground, is a key factor in determining the type of de-icing/anti-icing procedures. Figure 1 shows an icing event that occurred during an aircraft icing project, which took place in Eastern Canada
(a) (Isaac et al. 2005 ), and a severe frost condition that occurred during an ice fog project (b) (Gultepe et al. 2015 ). At the ground stops for aircraft, wet snow, freezing drizzle, or rain, with the ambient temperature around 0 /C176C or even in a temperature range between 8 /C176and 14 /C176C, can be critical for avi- ation operations (TC AIM 2019 ).
Wind shear and turbulence conditions can also be critical for aircraft ﬂight conditions, as clear air tur- bulence (CAT) can be reported anywhere during a
ﬂight path. The CAT events are usually related to frontal weather systems and jet cores called jet streaks (Fig. 2), with a sketch adapted from TC AIM
(2019 ), showing the possible areas of CAT conditions at the higher level of atmosphere (Fig. 2a). Figure 2b shows the airﬂow streamlines behind an aircraft taking off, indicating vortex core and vortex ﬂow directions. Based on these issues, the current special issue will present the recent works to advance the aviation meteorology science and operations.
For this volume we focused on scientiﬁc and operational issues that affect ﬂight conditions, such as aircraft climb, and drag and lift forces. The review paper by Gultepe et al. ( 2019a ) clearly shows that wind, turbulence (including gust), and visibility aremore often a cause of aircraft ﬂight disruptions, rather than other factors, such as icing conditions studied in
Chuang et al. (
2019 ), convection, and pollution-dust, which also play important roles for aviation opera- tions. Therefore, more research is needed to1Meteorological Research Division (MRD), Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), Toronto, ON M3H 5T4,Canada.

Aviation meteorology needs new instrumental platforms and analysis techniques to improve safety conditions for ﬂight environments. These platforms need to be developed as a part of integrated systems,such as ground based in situ observations, and remote sensing platforms, that include both ground and space based operational satellites. Although presentlyunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) platforms have not been used for operations, they are becoming very popular for atmospheric research, especially for dangerous con- ditions such as hurricanes, convective storms, and icing environments (Grifﬁn and Velden 2019 ), as well as NWP (numerical weather prediction) simu- lations and initializations. The UAVs can carry various miniature sensors for weather research and observations (Gultepe et al. 2019b ). In this topical special issue, the importance of UAVs for future atmospheric research has also been emphasized for high level and low-level ﬂight conditions and weather research.
Ground based in situ observations of various avi- ation meteorology related parameters can be obtained for extreme weather conditions within climate and wind tunnel laboratories (Gultepe et al. 2019b ). Two of these, including the University of Ontario Instituteof Technology (UOIT) climatic wind tunnel (CWT) and NASA Glen wind tunnel, have been used for simulating Arctic and icing environments, respec- tively (Gultepe et al. 2019a ). Climatic wind tunnel tests are also important for simulating aircraft aero- dynamic conditions that had been summarized by many others (Dodson 2005 ; Tomek et al. 2006 ; Bell
2002 ; Ross 2011 ).
Weather forecasts have been improved over short and long-time periods, using various analysis sys- tems, such as NWP models (Chachere and Pu 2019 ), nowcasting-based systems, integrated methods, and statistical-based methods such as neural network and

2019 ; Zheng et al. 2018 ). This topical issue provides the current status and challenges of these systems.
While none of these systems alone can provide accurate predictions of meteorological parameters over short or long-time periods, integrating these methods can be used more conﬁdently to improve aircraft physical and managerial ﬂying conditions, including conditions on the ground (Kutty et al. 2019 ;
Franc ¸a et al. 2019 ). Several papers focusing on these issues are included in this issue.
The accuracy of forecasting and nowcasting avia- tion weather using numerical models and remote sensing techniques still remains difﬁcult, mainly because of the lack of observations for physical and dynamical parameterizations as a part of numerical models (Weston et al. 2019 ). Presently, typical numerical forecast models lack sufﬁcient time and space resolutions and appropriate physical parameter- izations to represent aircraft scales (10–100 m) in estimating aerodynamic and microphysical processes.Simple approaches, e.g., using only temperature and relative humidity with respect to water (RH w) to cal- culate icing rates, can lead to uncertainties of more than
30% in many conditions.
This topical special issue points out that improve- ments of in situ observations and microphysical parameterizations are required to reduce aviation related accidents. Pu et al. ( 2019 ) stated the importance of microphysical parameterizations for convective systems and NWP sensitivity for various parameteri- zations. However, detailed 3D models do not representcertain scales and use large scale parameterizations for predictions; furthermore, these 3D models are cur- rently not practical to be used operationally because of processing time of numerical algorithms based on smaller time and space scales. The capability of these models needs to be improved mainly for wind speed and direction, gust, visibility and ceiling, convection, and icing conditions. For example, Gultepe et al.
(2019a ) stated that on average, 60 people die because of fog-related accidents every year in Canada, which is comparable to impacts resulting from other severe weather events, and these numbers can be much higher based on international considerations. In fact, the worst accident in aviation history occurred due to fog and low visibility impacting aircraft take off processes onMarch 27, 1977. Two Boeing 747 passenger airliners collided on the runway of Tenerife Airport on the
Spanish island of Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands.
The crash claimed a total of 583 fatalities (Smith 2017 ).
As is the case in most weather-related aviation acci- dents, several conditions combined leading to the accident occurrence, however certainly dense fog played a critical role. The two aircraft would have been aware of one another’s presence in fair conditions, but because of dense fog, neither aircraft could see one another until it was too late.
Global climate change issues are also critical for aviation operations. For example, temperature changes of a few /C176C can impact aircraft aerodynamical condi- tions such as lift and drag, as well as climb rates (Storer et al. 2019 ). Regional air pollution issues, including volcanic ash and dust conditions, also affect ﬂying conditions; but aircraft contrail formation due to exhaust gases during taking off or landing can also affect the weather and climate (Gultepe et al. 2014 ;
Heymsﬁeld et al. 1998 ,2010 ; Schumann 2002 ,2005 ).
Schumann and Heymsﬁeld ( 2017 ) stated that key parameters controlling contrail properties, besides aircraft and fuel properties, ambient pressure, temper- ature, and humidity, can be related to the number of ice particles per ﬂight distance surviving the wake vortex phase, the contrail depth and particle sedimentation, wind shear, turbulence, and vertical motions control- ling contrail dispersion. Contrail effect on climate change depends also on the ratio of shortwave to longwave radiative forcing (RF) that contributes to surface warming. Figure 3shows a contrail formation during an aircraft take off at the Yellow Knife Inter- national Airport, NWT, Canada (Fig. 3a, b). Figure 3c shows a contrail occurred due to a condensation process related to an aircraft jet exhaust (Schumann and
Heymsﬁeld 2017 ). However, we are just starting to understand these conditions and develop new methods to better evaluate contrail impact on the climate change, and develop, mitigation steps to reduce risk-related aircraft accidents and aircraft-related pollution.
Wind and turbulence activities factor into the air- craft landings and takeoffs conditions (Sharman and
Trier 2019 ). In reality, wind measurements at airports lack the needed resolution over the horizontal and vertical scales. Therefore, improvements in windmeasurements can only be done by using state of the artVol. 176, (2019) Aviation Meteorology: Observations and Models. Introduction 1865observational platforms such as lidars and UAVs
(Thobois et al. 2019 ; Gultepe et al. 2019b ). Doppler lidars (Thobois et al. 2019 ) adaptable for airport use can provide wind speed, directional shear, gust, andturbulence conditions over short time and space scales at airports and during landings and takeoffs. As a result, these new platforms can be used to more accurately deﬁne safety conditions for aviation applications.
While this publication broadly covers the whole of aviation meteorology, less information on Polar ﬂight conditionsis noted,although major issuesrelatedtocold temperature and snow conditions, as well as ice fog, are discussed extensively. To simulate Polar conditions, climate wind tunnels (e.g., UOIT CWT, Gultepe et al.
2019b ) can be used to test aircraft parts and pieces, but these also need to be validated using real ﬂight envi-ronments. In reality, freezing fog and ice fog occur often in cold climates, particularly in the high Arctic and
Antarctic regions, and can create adverse weather con- ditions for aviation and marine applications, that need to be addressed seriously as air trafﬁc and marine trans- portation increases over the Arctic regions.
